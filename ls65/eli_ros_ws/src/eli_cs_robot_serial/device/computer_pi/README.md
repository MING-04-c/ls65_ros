# Raspberry Pi TCP communication

The Raspberry Pi is expected to run a TCP server at `169.254.199.100:9001`.
This ROS 2 node runs as a TCP client and reconnects automatically after a
connection failure.

## Start

```bash
cd ~/project/ls65_ros/ls65/eli_ros_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash

ros2 launch eli_cs_robot_serial computer_pi_tcp.launch.py
```

Override the endpoint without editing the YAML file:

```bash
ros2 launch eli_cs_robot_serial computer_pi_tcp.launch.py \
  host:=192.168.1.20 port:=9000
```

## Receive

```bash
ros2 topic echo /computer_pi/rx
ros2 topic echo /computer_pi/rx_bytes
```

`/computer_pi/rx` publishes one message for every LF-terminated text line.
`/computer_pi/rx_bytes` publishes the same payload as a byte array.

## Send

```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /computer_pi/tx \
  std_msgs/msg/String "{data: 'hello pi'}"

ros2 topic pub --once /computer_pi/tx_float \
  std_msgs/msg/Float64 "{data: 3.14}"

ros2 topic pub --once /computer_pi/tx_int \
  std_msgs/msg/Int64 "{data: 42}"

ros2 service call /computer_pi/write \
  eli_cs_robot_serial/srv/WriteSerial "{data: 'hello pi'}"
```

Text, float, and integer messages are sent as ASCII followed by LF when
`append_newline: true`.

Send a file as raw binary data:

```bash
ros2 service call /computer_pi/send_file \
  eli_cs_robot_serial/srv/SendFile \
  "{path: '/home/robot/data.bin'}"
```

TCP is a byte stream and does not preserve message boundaries. Both computers
must use the same text delimiter or application-level binary frame format.

## Camera stream (MASC Camera TCP Protocol v1/v2)

The camera stream is independent of the text/debug connection on port 9001.
The camera computer runs `hik_camera_ros2_driver` and
`ros2 launch masc_user_serial masc_tcp.launch.py`, listening on
`169.254.199.100:9002`. This computer must have `169.254.199.250/24`
on its Ethernet interface because the server accepts only that source IP.

```bash
ros2 launch eli_cs_robot_serial computer_pi_camera_tcp.launch.py
```

The launch command also opens a live camera window. It displays the measured
receive FPS, accumulated frame count, image size, and source encoding. Press
`q` or `Esc` to close the window. On a headless machine, use
`show_image:=false`.

Protocol v1 carries JPEG frames. Protocol v2 carries exact ROS Image bytes
using the header fields `encoding`, `width`, `height`, `step`, and
`is_bigendian`. The receiver supports raw `rgb8`, `bgr8`, `rgba8`, `bgra8`,
`mono8`, `mono16`/`16UC1`, and common 8-bit Bayer frames. It converts raw
pixels to JPEG locally, reconnects after a disconnect, and publishes the JPEG as
`sensor_msgs/msg/CompressedImage` on
`/computer_pi/camera/image/compressed`, preserving the source frame ID and
timestamp. The latest JPEG and its JSON header are atomically saved to
`/tmp/computer_pi_camera/latest.jpg` and `latest.json`. The files are
overwritten on each frame. Set `latest_file:=''` to disable file output.

## ROS image topic and snapshot service

The image bridge republishes each decoded frame as
`sensor_msgs/msg/Image` with `bgr8` encoding on
`/computer_pi/camera/image`. It only copies the full raw image while that
topic has subscribers. The JPEG stream remains available on
`/computer_pi/camera/image/compressed`.

Save the latest received frame by calling:

```bash
ros2 service call /computer_pi/camera/capture std_srvs/srv/Trigger "{}"
```

A successful response contains the saved JPEG path. Files are named with the
capture time and are written to
`/home/robot/Pictures/computer_pi_camera` by default. The image topic and
capture service remain active when the launch argument `show_image:=false`
disables the window.

The launch arguments `host`, `port`, `local_ip`, `compressed_topic`,
`image_topic`, `capture_service`, `snapshot_directory`, `latest_file`,
`reconnect_period`, `jpeg_quality`, and `show_image` can be overridden. For example:

```bash
ros2 launch eli_cs_robot_serial computer_pi_camera_tcp.launch.py \
  host:=169.254.199.100 port:=9002 local_ip:=169.254.199.250
```

For raw data, the sender must use protocol `version: 2` and put the ROS
image encoding directly in `encoding`, for example `"encoding": "rgb8"`.
The payload length must equal `step * height`. The receiver validates the MIMG
magic, protocol version, JSON header, dimensions, byte order, row stride,
payload size, and length limits (64 KiB header, 128 MiB raw image). It reads
each field to completion because TCP does not preserve frame boundaries.
